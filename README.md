Part 1.

This assignment requires a json file to be saved in the MongoDB.
The json file contains data regarding multiple establishments in the UK. The filename is establishments.json
The process for generating the MongoDB database and uploading the json contents to that database on a local instance are provided at the  beginning of the NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb file.

Part 2.

The interrogation of the dataset is provided as a Jupyter notebook: NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb
This analysis requires the establishments.json dataset to be in local memory, so NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb should be run first.
